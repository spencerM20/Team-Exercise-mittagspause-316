Mass hyteria ensued when the plane transporting Rammstein crashed into the Flughafen upon landing.
Due to the chaos, John Elden Ring sprinted to Hauptstrasse Berlin to get himself 67 Bratwurst. 
Upon arriving, he found himself in a wettbewerbsfaehig "Glizzy Gobblers" competition taking place
in the Biergarten.
John Elden Ring dropped to his knees when he found out that they were eating Doener instead of glizzies.
He wasn't too upset as the proceeds for others to enter the competition went to a hund shelter. He later realized the money was used to buy Lederhose for the hunds, making them far more fashionable. 
The hund fashion show was going to be hosted at Schloss Eltz, and in a twist no one could explain, the organizers decided John Elden Ring was the only person qualified to host it.
John Elden Ring was overjoyed to be hosting the hund fashion show so he brought Gebaeck for the guests.
After celebrating his role in the hund fashion show, John Elden Ring needed to eat some Brot to sober himself up in time for the competition.
