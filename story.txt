Mass hyteria ensued when the plane transporting Rammstein crashed into the Flughafen upon landing.
Due to the chaos, John Elden Ring sprinted to Hauptstrasse Berlin to get himself 67 Bratwurst. 
Upon arriving, he found himself in a wettbewerbsfaehig "Glizzy Gobblers" competition taking place
in the Biergarten.
John Elden Ring dropped to his knees when he found out that they were eating Doener instead of glizzies.
He wasn't too upset as the proceeds for others to enter the competition went to a hund shelter. He later realized the money was used to buy Lederhose for the hunds, making them far more fashionable.
